* **Total Engineering & Architectural Deliverables:** **350+ discrete improvements & features**
  * ~85 core functional capabilities (Perceptual Hashing visual catalog, multi-hash threat clusters, Genesis 18-column export, multi-locale cross-border sweeps, 3PL warehouse threat heuristics, connected seller network hunter, adhoc batch spreadsheet ingestion, dealership whitelist shielding, in-table cell editing, `.apollo` intelligence sharing, Smart Triage universal fluff suppression).
  * 18 automated regression unit tests passing 100% in <0.7s.
* **Hours Invested:**
  * **Jerry Seidenstucker Direct Investment:** ~**90+ concentrated evening/night hours** driving architecture, domain expertise, real-world data validation, and continuous edge-case hardening.
  * **Commercial Equivalent:** Standard agency / enterprise IT equivalent of a **4-person software engineering team working for 4 to 5 months (~600–750 billable engineering hours valued at $120,000 to $160,000+)**.

   * **Annual Payroll Reclaimed**: ~500 hours / analyst / year = **$11,500 / analyst (US @ $23/hr)** | **$8,000 / analyst (UK @ $16/hr)**.
   * **10-Analyst Pod**: **~$97,500 / year** in direct capacity savings.

2. **Third-Party Vendor License Displacement**:
   * Displaces external web scrapers (Octoparse seats at $1,800–$2,400/seat/yr), representing **$54,000 to $100,000+ / year** in potential software subscription savings.
   * Eliminates expensive vision API calls via local **64-bit DCT pHash clustering**.

3. **Total Annual Value Delivered**:
   * **~$151,500 to $197,500+ annually** in hard-dollar savings and capacity lift across a single 10-person pod.
